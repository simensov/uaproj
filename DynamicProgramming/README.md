## Implementation of Randomized motion planning algorithm with pre-computed optimal policy [Frazzoli, 2002]

This implementation is done by Oliver Os (oliversos on GitHub). The motion planning is based on optimal policies that has to be pre-computed. Running on a HP Spectre takes approximately one hour. These CSV-files is made in bicycle_value_iteration.py. Then, algorithm.py loads the CSV-files and uses then for online path planning.
