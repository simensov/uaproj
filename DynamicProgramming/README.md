## Implementation of Randomized motion planning algorithm with pre-computed optimal policy [Frazzoli, 2002]

This implementation is done by Oliver Os (oliversos on GitHub). The motion planning is based on optimal policies that has to be pre-computed. Running on a HP Spectre takes approximately one hour.
