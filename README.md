# Git rep for project in 6.832 Underactuated Robotics, Spring 2019

Investigated RRT* for motion planning with differential and dynamic constraints, inspired by "Kinodynamic RRT* Optimal Motion Planning for Systems with Linear Differential Constraints" (Dustin J. Webb, Jur van den Berg, 2012), https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5088v1.

Another part in the project was done by implementing ideas from "Real-time motion planning for agile autonomous vehicles" (Emilio Frazzoli et. al., 2002), https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/945511.
