# 6.832 Underactuated Robotics project, Spring 2019

Investigated RRT* for motion planning with differential and dynamic constraints, inspired by "Sampling-based Optimal Motion Planning for Non-Holonomic Dynamical Systems" (Karaman,  Frazzoli, 2013 - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6631297) and "Kinodynamic RRT* - Optimal Motion Planning for Systems with Linear Differential Constraints" (Dustin J. Webb, Jur van den Berg, 2012 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5088v1.)

Another part in the project was done by implementing ideas from "Real-time motion planning for agile autonomous vehicles" (Emilio Frazzoli et. al., 2002), https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/945511.

The main goal of the project was to compare these two different methods. The results of the work was discussed in a final report delivered May 17 2019.

## File structure:

- RRT contains work aimed at the first paper mentioned above (By Simen Sem Oevereng)
- DynamicProgramming contains work aimed at the last paper (By Oliver Stugard Os)
